A little client-side loom simulator and generator to accompany my 2018 Strange Loop talk, ["'It's Just Matrix Multiplication': Notation For Weaving"](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2018/its-just-matrix-multiplication-notation-for-weaving.html).

This tool uses the [WIF file format](http://www.mhsoft.com/wif/wif.html) and should be compatible with weaving drafts you find elsewhere on the internet. (Though many will be intended for much wider fabrics than you'll want to weave on a shoebox loom.) Some starter WIFs are included in this repo.

The heddle frames generated can be cut out of cardboard and used in any kind of shoebox or backstrap loom. You can watch my [brief video on building a shoebox loom](https://vimeo.com/292752195) for some inspiration, or look around on Instructables -- [here's a nice one](https://www.instructables.com/id/Scrap-Bin-Rigid-Heddle-Loom/).
